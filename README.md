# odin-landingPage

In this project, I demonstrated my ability to use flexbox with basic styling to build a nice looking layout for a mockup webpage. The site is not optimized for a mobile device as of this point in time.

Throughout the building process, I learned:

- Margins and paddings and their shorthands
- Basic styling such as colors, borders, and fonts
- Flexbox and its functionalities
  - flex shorthand for grow, shrink, and basis
  - The main and cross axis and how they change depending on the flex-direction
  - justify-content
  - align-items
  - flex-direction
  - flex-wrap
  - gap
